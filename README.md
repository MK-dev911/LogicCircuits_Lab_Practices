# ‚öôÔ∏è Verilog Digital Circuits Collection

This repository contains a collection of **Verilog HDL** projects demonstrating a variety of basic digital logic circuits. This project includes:

- üìù **Description** of the circuit's function and design
- üíª **Verilog source code**
- üß™ **Testbenches** for simulation
- üìà **Waveform outputs** to verify functionality

The circuits are based on standard digital design schematics and are ideal for learning or teaching fundamental concepts in digital electronics.



## üß† Included Circuits

- Multiplexers (2:1, 4:1, etc.)
- Comparators
- Arithmetic units (adders, subtractors)
- Logic gate combinations
- Custom circuit designs based on schematics



> üìå Behavioral folder includes:  
> - Verilog module(s)  
> - Testbench file  
> - Optional waveform or simulation screenshot



## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and simulate the Verilog files, you'll need a Verilog-compatible tool such as:

- **ISE Xilinx** 
- **ModelSim**

### How to Simulate (with Icarus Verilog):

1. Run .xise file
2. Go to simioulation mode
3. Click Run Behavioral
